# CyborgLegends-Game
it's a game project with Javascript Framework ( Phaser 3 )
I made this game when I was 13 years old when I was still in the academy's intermediate timedoor class


this game has the theme of robots fighting zombies, you have to walk until cordit x reaches the desired distance and 
there will be a portal. before you reach the portal, there will be some obstacles like zombies, you have to fight 
them by shooting red fire using ( E ) and blue fire ( Q )
